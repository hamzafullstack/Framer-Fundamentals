## Anatomy of a Framer Project

### 1. Workspace
- **Highest level of organization** containing all your Framer projects.  
- Optional **folders** can be used to organize projects for better management.

### 2. Projects
- Each project is a **completely self contained website**.

### 3. Pages
- A project can contain **multiple pages**.
- The **"home" page** is the default page that loads when someone first visits your site.
- **Page name** determines the URL path (e.g., `/about`).
- **Page title** is metadata that appears in browser tabs and search results.
- Pages can be **organized into folders**, and the folder name will also become part of the URL path.

### 4. Design Canvas & Breakpoints
- The **design canvas** is where you create your page layouts.
- The main design area is called a **breakpoint**.
- Content **inside a breakpoint** will be visible on the published site.  
- Content **outside a breakpoint** will not appear.
- Multiple breakpoints can be added to a single page to create layouts for **different screen sizes** (desktop, tablet, phone).

### 5. Frames
- The most **fundamental building block** in Framer.
- Frames are **versatile rectangles** used for:
  - Layout
  - Grouping
  - Stacking
  - Creating grids
- They also function as a **basic rectangle shape**.
