# Getting familiar with the Framer interface

This is an introduction to the Framer interface, which is broken down into four key areas: the **Toolbar**, the **Left Sidebar**, the **Right Sidebar**, and the **Canvas**.

## **Key Interface Sections**

### 1. Toolbar
The toolbar is located at the top of the interface and has several important functions:
* **Framer Logo**: Opens the main menu with project-level actions and preferences.
* **Insert Panel**: This is where you can find and insert pages, design elements, and components. You can also access it with the **"I" key**.
* **CMS Button**: Takes you to the Content Management System view.
* **Quick Action Bar**: A powerful shortcut to search for and use menu items. Use `Command + K` on Mac or `Control + K` on PC to open it.
* **Project Information**: Shows the name of your project and its URL if it has been published.
* **Collaboration & Publishing**: This section contains tools for collaborating with others, setting up localization, previewing your site, and publishing it.

### 2. Left Sidebar
The left sidebar contains three main panels to help you navigate your project's structure:
* **Pages**: This panel displays all the pages on your site.
* **Layers**: This panel shows all the elements and their hierarchy on the current page.
* **Assets**: This is a library for all the components, styles, and code files you've created or imported into your project.

### 3. Right Sidebar
The right sidebar is where you'll find the **Properties Panel**. This panel is contextual, meaning the options it displays will change depending on what you have selected on the canvas. For example, selecting a text box will show font and color options, while selecting a breakpoint will show its layout properties.

### 4. Canvas
The canvas is the main design area where you build and edit your website. It's an infinite workspace where all your web page content is placed within **breakpoints**. At the bottom of the canvas, you'll find tools for panning, commenting, changing the interface from day to night mode, and zooming.
